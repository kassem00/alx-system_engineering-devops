### Web Infrastructure Design:

#### Components:
1. **Server:**
   - Physical or virtual machine hosting the entire web infrastructure.
   - Has a public IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8).

2. **Domain Name:**
   - Domain name: foobar.com
   - Configured with a www record pointing to the server's IP (www.foobar.com -> 8.8.8.8).

3. **DNS Record Type:**
   - The DNS record type for www in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. It is an alias of the domain foobar.com.

4. **Web Server (Nginx):**
   - Handles initial HTTP requests.
   - Responsible for static content delivery, SSL termination, and forwarding dynamic requests to the application server.
   - Communicates with the application server to process dynamic content.

5. **Application Server:**
   - Executes the web application codebase.
   - Processes dynamic requests forwarded by the web server.
   - Communicates with the MySQL database for data retrieval or updates.

6. **Application Files (Code Base):**
   - Contains the codebase for the web application.
   - Hosted on the application server.

7. **Database (MySQL):**
   - Stores and manages the website's data.
   - Interacts with the application server to handle data operations.

#### Communication Flow:
1. User accesses www.foobar.com.
2. Initial HTTP request is handled by the Nginx web server.
3. For dynamic content, Nginx forwards the request to the application server.
4. Application server executes the codebase and communicates with the MySQL database if necessary.
5. Application server sends dynamically generated content back to Nginx.
6. Nginx delivers the complete web page to the user's browser.

### Specifics about the Infrastructure:

1. **What is a Server:**
   - A server is a physical or virtual machine that provides services, resources, or functionalities to other computers (clients) in a network.

2. **Role of the Domain Name:**
   - The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-readable alias for the server's IP address. It enables users to access the website using a memorable name.

3. **Type of DNS Record for www:**
   - The DNS record type for www in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record.

4. **Role of the Web Server (Nginx):**
   - The web server (Nginx) handles initial HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

5. **Role of the Application Server:**
   - The application server executes the web application codebase, processes dynamic requests, and communicates with the database.

6. **Role of the Database (MySQL):**
   - The MySQL database stores and manages the website's data, interacting with the application server for data operations.

7. **Server's Communication with User's Computer:**
   - The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, delivering web pages in response to user requests.

### Issues with the Infrastructure:

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
   - The infrastructure has a single server, making it vulnerable to failure. If the server goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible.
   - Mitigation: Consider introducing redundancy and load balancing by adding more servers.

2. **Downtime During Maintenance:**
   - Deploying new code or performing maintenance on the web server may lead to downtime.
   - Mitigation: Implement redundancy, load balancing, and rolling deployments for seamless updates.

3. **Cannot Scale with Incoming Traffic:**
   - The infrastructure may struggle to handle high traffic volumes.
   - Mitigation: Implement horizontal scaling by adding more servers and distributing the load using a load balancer.
