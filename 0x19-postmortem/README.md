#### Summary

**Date**: June 8th, 2024  
**Duration**: 14:00 UTC - 15:00 UTC  
**Impact**: Nginx crashed, causing the website to be completely inaccessible. Approximately 80% of users experienced downtime.  
**Root Cause**: Nginx server overloaded due to unexpected high traffic.

#### Timeline

- **14:00 UTC** - Issue detected (Nginx crash, website down).
- **14:05 UTC** - Monitoring alerts triggered, engineers notified.
- **14:10 UTC** - Initial investigation into server load and traffic patterns.
- **14:20 UTC** - Identified high traffic spike causing overload.
- **14:30 UTC** - Began scaling up additional servers to distribute load.
- **14:40 UTC** - Restarted Nginx, began traffic rerouting.
- **14:50 UTC** - Traffic normalized, service restored.
- **15:00 UTC** - Full resolution, site operational.

#### Root Cause and Resolution

The Nginx server crashed due to an unexpected spike in traffic, overwhelming the server capacity. The issue was resolved by scaling up additional servers to handle the load and restarting Nginx.

#### Corrective and Preventive Measures

- **Improvements**: Implement auto-scaling for handling traffic spikes, improve monitoring alerts.
- **Tasks**:
  - Configure auto-scaling for Nginx servers.
  - Enhance monitoring to detect high traffic early.
  - Conduct load testing to understand capacity limits.
  - Optimize Nginx configuration for better performance under high load.

#### Humorous Twist

Imagine Nginx as a bouncer at a nightclub. One night, the club got so popular that the bouncer couldn't handle the crowd, leading to chaos inside. We fixed it by hiring more bouncers and setting up better crowd control measures. Now, Nginx the bouncer is ready for the next big party!
